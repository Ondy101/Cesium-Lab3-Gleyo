                Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a fighting game for up to eight players in which 
                characters from Nintendo games and other third-party franchises must try to knock 
                each other out of an arena. The game brings back every fighter in the history of 
                the series, adds newcomers and over 100 stages, and introduces a new adventure 
                mode called "World of Light".
